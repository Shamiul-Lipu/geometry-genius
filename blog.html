                1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?
            </h3>
            <p>
                <!-- answer -->
                DOM stands for Document Object Model.Its how a web browser represents a web page internally.The DOM
                determines what content should be on a page and how each element of the content relates to the other
                elements.It is a programming interface that allows us to create, change, or remove elements from the
                document. We can also add events to these elements to make our page more dynamic.
                <br>
                With the Document Object Model, programmers can build documents, navigate their structure, and add,
                modify,
                or delete elements and content.
                By manipulating the DOM, we have infinite possibilities. we can create applications that update the data
                of
                the page without needing a refresh. Also, we can create applications that are customizable by the user
                and
                then change the layout of the page without a refresh. we can drag, move, and delete elements.

                2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.
            </h3>
            <p>
                <!-- answer -->
                We can select any element by using DOM. There are 5 ways in which you can select elements in a DOM using
                selectors. <br>
                getElementsByTagName() <br>
                getElementsByClassName() <br>
                getElementById() <br>
                querySelector() <br>
                querySelectorAll() <br>
                The DOM has a lot of methods. They are the connection between our nodes (elements) and events
                <br>
                here are six different methods in which users can access or manipulate HTML elements using JavaScript:
                <br>
                HTML DOM getElementById() <br>
                HTML DOM getElementsByClassName() <br>
                HTML DOM getElementsByName() <br>
                HTML DOM getElementsByTagName() <br>
                HTML DOM querySelector() <br>
            </p>
        </div>

                3. What is event bubble?
            </h3>
            <p>
                <!-- answer -->
                When an event happens on an element, it first runs the handlers on it, then on its parent, then all the
                way
                up on other ancestors. Event Bubbling is a concept in the DOM. It happens when an element receives an
                event,
                and that event bubbles up or can say is transmitted or propagated to its parent and ancestor elements in
                the
                DOM tree until it gets to the root element.

                There are a bunch of events where some activity is performed by the user or browser. When the JavaScript
                code is included in the HTML, JavaScript will react to the events. This process of reacting to events is
                known as Event handling.

                4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?
            </h3>
            <p>
                <!-- answer -->
                A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked
                inside
                the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. A function that accepts other functions
                as
                arguments is called a higher-order function, which contains the logic for when the callback function
                gets
                executed. Its the combination of these two that allow us to extend our functionality.A callback function
                is
                a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function
                to
                complete some kind of routine or action.

                <br>
                Callbacks ensure that the function will not run before the task is completed but will run right after
                the
                task is completed. It develops asynchronous JavaScript code and keeps them safe from errors.
